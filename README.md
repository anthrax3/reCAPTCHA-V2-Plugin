# reCAPTCHA-V2-Plugin
reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your site from spam and abuse. This plugin is developed for the b2evolution CMS platform. It uses advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots apart. With the new API, a significant number of your valid human users will pass the reCAPTCHA challenge without having to solve a CAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA comes in the form of a widget that you can easily add to your blog, forum, registration form, etc.
